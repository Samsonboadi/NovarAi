### Basic Pattern:
```
Show me [WHAT] near [WHERE]
```
**Example**: "Show me buildings near Amsterdam Centraal"

### With Filters:
```
Find [WHAT] in [WHERE] with [CONDITION]
```
**Example**: "Find buildings in Rotterdam with area > 500m¬≤"

### Time-based:
```
Show me [WHAT] near [WHERE] built [WHEN]
```
**Example**: "Show me buildings near Utrecht built before 1950"

### Street-specific:
```
Get [WHAT] on [STREET] in [CITY]
```
**Example**: "Get addresses on Damrak street in Amsterdam"

## üèóÔ∏è What You Can Search For

| **Type** | **Keywords** | **Example** |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Buildings | buildings, pand, properties | "buildings near station" |
| Addresses | addresses, properties, locations | "addresses on street X" |
| Land Parcels | parcels, land, property boundaries | "large parcels near city" |
| Geographic Features | water, roads, green spaces | "water features in area" |

## üîß Useful Filters

| **Filter Type** | **How to Use** | **Example** |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Area/Size** | "with area > 300m¬≤", "larger than 500m¬≤" | "buildings with area > 300m¬≤" |
| **Year** | "built before 1950", "constructed after 2000" | "built before 1950" |
| **Location** | "near [landmark]", "in [city]", "around [address]" | "near Amsterdam Centraal" |
| **Street** | "on [street name]", "along [road]" | "on Damrak street" |
